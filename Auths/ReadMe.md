# Research on Authentication & Authorization with Django

## Session vs JWT vs OAuth2 & OpenID Connect  - Django

### In multi application architecture, front-end is always making connections with back-end server. In between this communication, application layer logic needs to identify whether a request has authentication and then whether it has certain level of authorization to keep communicating within certain protocol. In this research, I am going to work on APIs and both authentication & authorization of users. For that 3 important architectures are taken to follow up in django based application.
